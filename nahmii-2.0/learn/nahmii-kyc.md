# nahmii-kyc

Nahmii was built with a core focus on institutions and commercial entities, but is open to the general crypto community. Being built for a wide range of financial use cases, Nahmii is ready to comply with regulations, especially those bordering on Know-Your-Customer (KYC), Know-Your-Transaction (KYT) and Anti-Money Laundering rules (AML).

The mix of communities and requirements affords Nahmii the opportunity to run both a permissioned/less form of protocol tailored to specific designs.
