# Overview

Nahmii was designed to be a commercially viable scaling protocol for Ethereum, as there was a constant need for block-space on the base layer due to increased demand from network participants.

The protocol leverages the **base layer's security** (Ethereum) which focuses on the other components of the blockchain trilemma, which are speed and decentralization. The results of this is seen as the protocol USPs which are **high transaction throughput**, **low latency**, **instant finality**, **low fees** and **predictable fees**.
