# transaction-fees

Transaction fees on Nahmii are charged based on the complexity of the executed code in a smart contract call.

Nahmii utilizes the same gas requirements just like the base layer due to its compactible virtual machine, Nahmii Virtual Machine (NVM). Despite this compactibility, transactions on Nahmii are predictable due to a fixed gas price that portrays  stability over extended periods of time.\

ETH, like other L2s, is now utilized as the fee-paying currency for contract execution. Following that, it will be replaced by the usage of a varied model (other currencies) that allows for a stronger and more robust user experience with ETH as the primary currency.
