Nahmii is built to provide a horizontal and elastic scaling, which transcends that there's **no limit** to the transactions that can be processed per second.

The Nahmii's architecture features an industry first low latency for transactions and avoids constant commit to the base layer due to its state channel-like similarity. These ensure all processed transactions are **instant, final and can't be reversed.**
