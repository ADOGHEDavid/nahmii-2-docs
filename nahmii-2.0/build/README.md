# Build

Welcome to Nahmii build!&#x20;

This page offers a great resource for getting started on Nahmii, building your dapp experience on the Nahmii Blockchain as it offers instant finality, low latency and predictable gas fees.

We have curated a couple of topics here, do take a look at the list on the document. Finally, we aim to maintain this doc witrh many guides as developers' interactions increases on the Network.

### Missing a guide?

What topic should we cover? What important guide are we missing? We'll love you to raise a [github issue](https://github.com/nahmii-community/nahmii-2-docs/issues) or speak to us on [discord](https://discord.gg/GKTsUTH).
